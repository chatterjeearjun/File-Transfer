Hereâ€™s an updated version of the formal complaint that includes the issue of continued communication from Lijo and Mahnaz after your resignation:

**Subject: Formal Complaint and Request for Confirmation of Release**

Dear [HR Representative],

I am writing to formally submit a complaint regarding the hostile work environment and harassment I experienced during my employment at TD Bank, which has ultimately forced me to resign. I also request confirmation of my release date, effective September 16th, 2024, as previously communicated.

To summarize the situation:

1. **Request for Accommodation**: On July 9th, 2024, I requested a modified work schedule due to pregnancy-related health concerns, including severe exhaustion, back pain, and general discomfort. My request was denied by my practice lead, Mahnaz Ahmadi, who dismissed my health condition and threatened me with termination if I pursued the accommodation further.

2. **Hostile Environment**: Despite receiving temporary support from AVP Laura Apostoloiu, who allowed me to work from home, the situation continued to deteriorate. I was subjected to unrealistic performance expectations, unwarranted criticism, and an increasing workload during my pregnancy, all of which caused significant mental and physical distress.

3. **Harassment**: I was repeatedly threatened by Mahnaz, including a final communication where she suggested that I either explore other opportunities at TD or resign. The ongoing pressure and hostility made it impossible for me to continue working in a safe and supportive environment, leaving me with no option but to resign to protect my health.

4. **Post-Resignation Conduct**: Despite submitting my resignation, effective September 16th, 2024, I have continued to receive emails from Lijo and Mahnaz. These communications, filled with unrelated details and an unnecessarily arrogant tone, seem intended to prolong the harassment. It is inappropriate and unprofessional to continue sending such emails after my resignation has been submitted and accepted.

Given the cumulative effect of these issues, I request that this complaint be formally documented in my employee record. Additionally, I seek confirmation of my resignation and release date, as well as an immediate end to all further communications from Lijo and Mahnaz, as they are causing unnecessary stress during my pregnancy.

I trust TD Bank will act swiftly to resolve this matter and ensure no further harassment occurs. Please confirm my release and provide guidance on any final steps required for my exit process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name]
