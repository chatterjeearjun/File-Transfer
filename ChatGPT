Thank you for your response and clarification regarding the check-in summary. However, I must emphasize that Mahnazâ€™s involvement has only added unnecessary pressure and further complicated the situation. If the check-in summary was based solely on your feedback, we could have discussed and resolved the issues directly. Unfortunately, by involving Mahnaz, who has once again engaged in her usual blame-shifting, I am left with no choice but to resign.

I also want to make it clear that I do not accept the feedback provided, as I find it biased and not reflective of my actual work. These assessments feel unfair and, in my view, are not applicable to my contributions. It is important to note that these negative comments started appearing after my work schedule modification request on July 10th, which raises concerns about their legitimacy.

Since last Friday, I have been under significant stress, resulting in several visits to the doctor. As mentioned in the attached medical note, my doctor has advised me to step away from this high-stress environment, which is no longer safe for me or my unborn child. I cannot continue in this toxic work culture, and effective immediately, I wish to exit.

Please confirm my last working date at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your understanding.
