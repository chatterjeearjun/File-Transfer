Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Policy Violations, Retaliation, and Ongoing Harassment

Dear [HR's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. Before we proceed with the detailed issues I am about to outline, I want to ensure that you are fully aware of my current situation, which significantly impacts the context of my concerns.
I am writing to formally express my concerns regarding ongoing harassment, retaliatory behavior, and violations of TD Bank’s policies by Mahnaz Ahmadi and Lijo Antony, as well as post-resignation communications that continue to add undue stress.

Please find attached a recent communication I received from Mahnaz, which highlights several issues. I believe this conduct violates TD Bank’s Respectful Workplace Policy and Code of Conduct. Specifically, I would like to highlight the following problematic sections from the email:

"You have the option to explore other TD opportunities or to resign from your position."

This phrase can be interpreted as pressuring me to resign, which, especially in the context of ongoing harassment, feels coercive. Given the current work environment, this is exacerbating the hostile situation, which violates TD’s Respectful Workplace Policy that ensures employees are not forced into decisions due to a hostile environment.
"It is not acceptable to threaten not to support your colleagues or to refuse to meet daily targets."

This accusatory statement is unfounded and is being used to dismiss my valid concerns. There has been no such behavior from my end, and this baseless accusation feels retaliatory for having raised previous issues. This directly violates TD’s policy against retaliation for raising concerns about working conditions and accommodations.
"Ignoring these concerns and linking them to unrelated work-from-office agreements..."

This statement shows a disregard for my health-related accommodation requests. As discussed with Laura and HR, my work-from-home request was health-related, and this dismissal is in direct violation of TD’s policy on supporting health-related accommodations.
"This approach is not acceptable."

The harsh tone used here regarding my request for Knowledge Transfer (KT) reflects a lack of willingness to assist, fostering an environment where I am not supported in completing my work. This diminishes my efforts and is inconsistent with TD’s values of collaboration and support.
"Failing to perform this responsibility, refusing to commit to daily targets, and declining to participate in performance evaluations are clear indications of neglecting your employee responsibilities."

This statement is particularly concerning as it attempts to undermine my contributions and medical accommodations by suggesting I am using them to avoid work. This is retaliatory and dismissive of the challenges I am facing. It further exacerbates the mental stress I have been under, which directly contradicts TD’s Respectful Workplace Policy.
In addition to this, I would like to reiterate that as an Associate Quality Engineer, I have been tasked with leading three different PODs simultaneously. While I have consistently put my best effort into each, this expectation is unreasonable and beyond what is typically expected for my role. The work I have delivered, particularly in the Platform and Performance POD, has been of high quality and without any flaws, as acknowledged in the past. However, I am now being assigned unrelated and additional tasks, which are being used as grounds to criticize my performance. This feels like a tactic to push me out of the organization voluntarily, which is adding significant pressure.

Further, as a clear act of retaliation, on July 25th, I was introduced to a new micromanagement tool called DSR (Daily Status Report), which was specifically implemented for me. This tool tracks every minute of my work and what I do throughout the day. This level of scrutiny is excessive and was not imposed on others before. It is further evidence of the retaliatory treatment I am being subjected to, adding unnecessary stress to an already overwhelming situation.

Despite raising all these concerns, I am deeply disappointed to see that no resolution has been made. I have escalated the matter to higher management, including Laura, who has not made any effort to respond or step in to resolve this ongoing situation. I would have expected more from such a prestigious organization, but it appears that even after highlighting these serious issues, no action has been taken.

I find myself in an increasingly unsafe work environment, and I am left feeling powerless in a situation where those with greater authority are not willing to intervene. At this point, I am only seeking a smooth release from TD Bank and for arrangements to be made for the collection of my laptop and other accessories from my home. I wish to avoid any further conflict and undue stress.

I strongly urge you to consider conducting anonymous skip-level meetings within the team. I believe this will reveal the mental stress and pressure that many of us are facing, a situation that has unfortunately occurred with previous employees, such as Mariam and Mirka. No actions were taken previously, and now, similar tactics are being employed against me.

I had no intention of leaving TD Bank, as it has always been a dream company for me to work for and excel in. However, the ongoing harassment, retaliatory conduct, and unreasonable demands have created an unsafe working environment for me. Despite my resignation, I continue to receive emails filled with unwarranted arrogance, further provoking unnecessary stress.

I request that you acknowledge these violations and take the necessary steps to address this conduct. Moreover, I urge you to confirm my release request at your earliest convenience and arrange for the laptop pickup to avoid further prolongation of this stressful situation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I hope for a swift resolution.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
Associate Quality Engineer
TD Bank
