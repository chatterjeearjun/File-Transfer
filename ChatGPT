Subject: Resignation from Associate Quality Engineer Position

Dear Lijo,

I am writing to formally submit my resignation from my role as Associate Quality Engineer at TD Bank, effective September 16th, 2024. Unfortunately, I have experienced significant distress and mental strain due to micromanagement practices, particularly from Mahnaz, whose actions have involved targeting me with misleading and inaccurate assessments of my performance. Despite my best efforts, these assessments do not align with my actual contributions, and I have not agreed with the performance objectives or career goals set for me.

It seems like lower-level employees have no rights to speak up about unfair practices and are constantly threatened, as if targeting people is a one-way process. There is no reverse feedback mechanism in place to address these concerns. This has not only harmed my productivity but has also negatively impacted my health. Fighting this has caused an increase in my heartbeat and affected the health of my unborn child. I cannot continue to fight anymore.

Moreover, the increased workload has become unmanageable. I am now responsible for Platform Performance work, extra Release Regression work, and additional Platform Ops POD work—without any prior consultation. These additional tasks have been imposed on me and unfairly added to my targets without any consideration of my capacity or well-being.

During my pregnancy, the workload has continued to increase, and I have raised concerns about bottlenecks and management issues within the mobile QA team on several occasions, including on August 30th, 2024. Additionally, I highlighted the personal biases I’ve experienced from Mahnaz during our discussions on July 10th, 2024. Despite receiving supportive feedback in my 1:1s with you, where I was only advised to act more proactively across teams, Mahnaz’s feedback has consistently been negative, though it is unclear where these claims originated from.

Laura, thank you for your support in approving my WFH requests. As I feared earlier, despite putting in 100% effort and delivering work with no quality gaps, I have been unfairly targeted in my performance discussions. In my 1:1 with Lijo, the only feedback I received was to be more proactive, not just in my POD but across other teams as well. It remains unclear how Mahnaz received vague negative feedback and from whom. I cannot change the way the QA Mobile team operates, and I am now overwhelmed with the growing workload and daily targets beyond my POD responsibilities. I simply cannot manage this any longer.

I kindly request that my last working day be confirmed as September 16th, 2024.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
