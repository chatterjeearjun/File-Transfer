Yes, service deployment and Pioneer to OnPrem cutover would happen on 11/21.

Hi Team,

Apologies for the confusion regarding the service endpoints. These are not live yet, as we are currently in the process of migration. We are aiming to complete the migration and deployment of the following services by 11/22, so the production endpoints will be available after that date.

We’ve received the IP addresses for the on-prem environments. If you could ensure these IPs are within the whitelisted range, we should be all set from an integration standpoint.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.


Hi Cyndi, is it essential for the above repositories to be associated with the DAST scan for this release, or is it more of a "nice-to-have"? If we exclude CMUM_User_Service and CGX_UM_Authorization_SVC, as there were no changes made to those services in version 24.11, the remaining applications already meet compliance requirements.

Hi Priyanka,

I’ve taken some time to reflect on our discussion yesterday. I feel that the current role leans heavily towards management and coordination, with a significant amount of my energy being spent in multiple meetings throughout the day. As someone with a technical background, I’m finding that it doesn’t align as well with my long-term career path. I believe an SRE role would be a better fit for me moving forward.

If possible, could you please consider releasing me from this project so I can focus on the SRE team?

Thank you for your understanding and support.


Fast Lane Deployment & Migration Update: CGX Applications (11/21)
Hi Team,

A quick heads-up: we’re planning a fast-lane deployment for several CGX applications and services on 11/21.

This is part of our migration effort to move services from the Pioneer environment to an on-premises setup, as the Pioneer environment is scheduled for decommissioning in January 2025. This migration is strictly an environment shift, with no changes to logic or code.

For Milestone 1, we’re aiming for a First Lane release on 11/21 for affected services, aligning with the R24.11 integrated release for consuming applications. We’ve set up a LaunchDarkly flag in all consuming applications, which will initially default to OFF (pointing to Pioneer). After the on-prem deployment on 11/21, we’ll switch the flag to ON.

We’ll need your support with PPV coordination after the release to complete our part. Please let us know if you need any further details, and we can schedule a call to discuss.
Thanks,


Migration Plan Review: M1 Pioneer to On-Prem Transition

Hi Cyndi, I noticed you’re out sick today—hope you feel better soon!

I'm reaching out from the Tech Enablement 5 group regarding our migration of several services from the Pioneer environment to an on-premises setup. Since the Pioneer environment is cost-effective but scheduled for decommissioning in January 2025, this migration is purely an environment shift with no logic or code changes required.

For Milestone 1, we’re planning a First Lane release on 11/21 for these services, aligning with the integrated R24.11 application release. We’ve implemented a LaunchDarkly flag in all consuming applications, which will default to OFF (pointing to Pioneer). After the service deployment to on-prem on 11/21, we’ll switch it ON.

I’ll schedule a call with you in the morning to review the plan. Please feel free to reschedule if that time isn’t convenient for you.

Hi Jason, we've created the initial set of stories for M1, along with some for M2 and M3. I'll share these with you shortly. However, I think it would be beneficial to have a broader discussion to ensure we allocate enough code freeze time for the migrations, as we have critical timelines to meet.

We had internal discussions with the team and Noorul, and we'd like to explore with Dan the possibility of moving our services and changes without a PPV. Given the tight deadline for the Pioneer migration, we're planning to implement more frequent first-lane deployments to stay on track. We'll be speaking with Dan today to go over the updated deployment plan.
Subject: Pioneer/On-Prem URLs for QA (M1 Services)
Hi Nathika,

Could you please complete the Excel sheet with the Pioneer and on-prem URLs for the QA Stress and QA environments for M1 services?


We are migrating all services from the Pioneer environment to an on-premises setup. Since the Pioneer environment is cost-effective but scheduled for decommissioning in January 2025, this migration involves only an environment shift—no location or code changes will be required.
On the application side, we have added a flag to toggle between the on-premises and Pioneer environments. This serves as a precautionary measure, allowing us to switch back to Pioneer if any issues arise in the on-premises setup.

Hi Dan,

We've finalized the migration plan and would need your assistance with the following challenges:

For Milestone 1, DevOps alignment is completed, but we need to merge the changes into the main branch to prevent GLAPI failures. This requires us to complete the migration on two separate dates: 15/11 with the regular release for applications with the Switching LD flag turned OFF, and then switching it ON on 21/11 alongside the service deployment. This will be a first-line deployment.

PPV validation alignment is needed for our release on 21/11 and switching ON to the on-premises environment. Without alignment, we won’t be able to switch the application ON until the next integrated release in December.

For Milestones 3 and 4, the code freeze dates are highlighted in the attached Excel file. Please help us coordinate team alignment for a smoother migration timeline.

Please let us know if you need any further information so we can arrange a call to discuss.

Thank you!

1. For Milestone 1 Devops alignment completed, we need to merge the changes to main otherwise GLAPI will fail so needed us to complete migration in 2 different dates(15/11 with regular release for applications with Switching LD flag OFF and then turning it on 21/11 alongside service deploymnet, this is going to be a first line deployment ).
1. PPV validation alignment needed for our release on 21/11 and switching ON to the On prem environmnet.If not alighen we can't switch the appplication ON till the next integrated release in Dec.
3. For milestone 3 & 4 codefreeze dates highightedin the atached excel, please help us getting teams alighment for our migration timeline convenience.



We have finalized all M1 stories. Could you please create test cases for them and attach the QTest results to each individual story? Thank you!

Hi Team,

Could you please work on the following consuming apps and services using the respective migration branch and verify if the SAST/DAST scan reports are generated:

Letter Angular
CGX Fileshare
Letter Service
CGX Assessment Service
CGX Authorization Service
For any guidance, feel free to reach out to Sridhar. Thank you!

Hi Team,

As mentioned, we are preparing to deploy seven applications—Letter Angular, Core API, Clinical Auth Service, CGX UI, Careplan UI, CGX Fileshare, and CGX API—and six services: Letters, CGX Careplan, AUTH Validation, CGX Assessment, CGX Authorization, and CGX Fax Service as part of our Milestone 1 plan.

Considering the critical timeline and to avoid impacting the current release, we’ve decided to move our deployment to the week following the regular release date. Tentatively, we’re aiming for Services to be deployed in production on 15/11 and consuming applications on 22/11. We’ll proceed with an ICAB change order, and we’d like to confirm if we can deploy the services and dependent applications directly from the migration branch, separately from the release branch. If so, what would be the recommended approach for merging changes back from the migration branch to the main branch?

Additionally, could you please confirm the process for toggling LaunchDarkly flags in production? Specifically, do we need any approvals to enable or disable these flags in production?

Thank you for your assistance!

Hi Shiva,

We are planning to deploy seven applications: Letter Angular, Core API, Clinical Auth Service, CGX UI, Careplan UI, CGX Fileshare, and CGX API; along with six services: Letters, CGX Careplan, AUTH Validation, CGX Assessment, CGX Authorization, and CGX Fax Service.

As part of our Milestone 1 plan, we’ve completed SIT functional testing (manual) for most of these in the QA3 environment. We’d like to ask for your support with automation test scenarios and recording results in QTest, mapped to individual stories.

Could you please confirm the following:

Is there a specific environment where we should deploy the code to run automated regression?
Is there a particular branch or build required for deployment, or is deploying from the migration branch sufficient?
How do we link QTest results to the individual stories?
Approximately how long would it take to complete regression for these seven applications?
Do we have any automated load testing setup for the six services?
Thank you for your guidance!

7 applications-
Letter Angular
Core API
Clinical Auth Service
CGX UI
Careplan UI
CGX Fileshare
CGX API

6 services-
Letters
CGXCareplan
AUTH validation
CGXAssessment
CGXAuthorization
CGXFaxService


Thank you for the confirmation! I was able to edit and submit my time for today. However, for the rest of the week (28/10-31/10), 
the timesheet shows as frozen or the hours are not editable for the assigned tasks. Could you please assist by filling in the hours for the remainder of the week from the backend? 
I’ll reach out if I encounter any issues with time entry from next week onward. Thank you!

SIT Functional Testing: Manual testing for SIT has been completed in both INT and QA3 environments.

API Testing: Except for the CGX Assessment, no API testing has been conducted for the service migration. (Blocked due to pending JSON files from developers.)

Letter Service Testing: 

Functional testing of Letter Angular and Core API applications has been completed in INT.
 Clinical Auth Service and CGX UI for the Letters service have been recently deployed to QA3, but testing has not yet occurred in INT.

CGX Careplan Service: Careplan UI, Core API, and CGX Fileshare (pending in QA) have been validated in both INT and QA3. CGX Fileshare testing can be completed today if a developer becomes available.

CGX Assessment Service: Testing of CGX UI for this service has been completed in both INT and QA.

CGX Authorization Service: Testing of CGX API, CGX UI, and Clinical Auth Service has been completed in QA.

We're fast-tracking the Milestone 1 release with isolated branch changes, aiming for deployment on 15/11 and app toggle on 22/11, pending ICAB approval and SRE/DevOps support

For the Milestone 1 release, we are already significantly behind the regular release cycle, so we plan to fast-track deployment. 
Our changes are isolated in a separate branch (not in the release branch). As part of the service deployment,
we intend to execute the change order for the services on 15/11, which will establish the on-premises environment. 
For the changes on the consuming apps side, we’re aiming for a scheduled release on 22/11, 
where we will implement a switch in the consuming apps to toggle from the Pioneer to the on-prem solution.

We have completed manual QA regression on our side, but we still need to wait for automated regression 
and load test results to validate and compare. We are treating this as an Infrastructure Change Order (ICAB) 
and would like to proceed on the mentioned dates. Your and the VP's approval is requested, 
along with support from the SRE and DevOps teams for the release activities.


I tried searching for the course by name or ID but couldn’t locate it. It seems it may need to be assigned to me for access. Could you please check on this?

M1-CGXCareplan: Migration of CGX Careplan Pioneer to On-Premises Service

The CGX Careplan Pioneer service is scheduled for sunset in January, with no planned renewal. To ensure service continuity, we must migrate all infrastructure associated with Pioneer to an on-premises environment through a lift-and-shift approach. This migration will involve setting up the on-premises infrastructure, ensuring full functional validation post-migration, and confirming compliance with all security and performance standards.

All components of the Pioneer service infrastructure are successfully migrated to the on-premises environment.
Network settings, data storage, and other resources are configured to match the current setup.
Functional validation is completed to confirm all features operate as expected in the on-premises setup.


Hi Becky, it seems that both SitecoreService and SiteScope are no longer necessary. Since the Sitecore applications aren’t active, 
the service account is also no longer needed. SiteScope monitoring was scheduled to sunset as early as 2021, 
and all applications were expected to transition to Dynatrace monitoring from that point. 
To answer your question, both are legacy and no longer required.

Slide 1: Hurdles for Pioneer Migration (Milestone 2 & 3)
Toggle Key Features Update

Excluding Humana.Clinical.Cgx.AuthUpdateUtility, other Toggle Key features removed from Milestones 2 and 3.
Streamlined as config-only updates, reducing team overhead and accelerating the timeline.
Single Branch Deployment

Transition to a single branch deployment model.
Application teams required to merge changes from the default branch independently as platform changes progress.
Limited Rollback Support

Minimal rollback options; parallel old-new system testing is restricted due to tight deadlines.
Issues to be handled with immediate resolutions to maintain stability.
Stakeholder Management

Complexity in maintaining stakeholder communication on the migration process, risks, and critical timelines.
Slide 2: Expectations and Preparations for Migration
Setting Realistic Performance Expectations

Transparent expectations around potential performance drops and downtimes during migration phases.
Data Clarity for Compliance

Identify data types within Pioneer for data security and compliance aligned with Data Governance requirements.
Post-Migration Monitoring

Limited insights on performance, error tracking, logs, and metrics post-migration due to Dynatrace and Splunk transitions.
Incident Handling Runbook

Prepare a runbook for incident management post-migration, specifying no rollback requirements for streamlined issue handling.
Traffic Results and Benchmarking

Collect necessary information to traffic and compare results, enabling accurate benchmarking post-migration.

Removing Toggle Key features from milestone 2 and 3 except for Humana.Clinical.Cgx.AuthUpdateUtility, which consumes ClinicalAuthorization
Single branch deployment going forward, if any application team wants to integrate our changes it's their responsibility to merge from default branch as this is a platform level changes.
Little to no support of roll back for the upcoming milestones not much option to run the old and new systems in parallel to ensure stability as the timeline is critical so any issues occurs we need to resolve it. 
Difficulty in maintaining stakeholders about migration process, risk and timelines
Establish realistic expactation regarding performace and potential downtimes during the migration
Clarity on kind of data that has been stored in pioneer platform for data security and compliance(Data govonance team)
no clarity on monitoring performace, errors, logs, matrics post migration tuning -- Onprem already hosted installed dynatrace switching, splunk
Create runbook for any incident handling for post migration issues -- no need for runbook
need information to traffic results to compare


Our action item for cgx_faxservice is to merge the code into our branch, deploy it in INT, and inform the team to initiate another round of SIT.

He is currently facing a certificate issue in his local environment for the Clinical Auth Service. The simplest solution would be to remove the feature flag and directly update the configuration for the Auth service. Considering the future projections, it seems reasonable to proceed without the feature flag to avoid being blocked by the certificate issue. Could you please confirm this exception, or should we seek additional support for him soon?
