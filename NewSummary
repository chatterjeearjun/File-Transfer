We have finalized all M1 stories. Could you please create test cases for them and attach the QTest results to each individual story? Thank you!

Hi Team,

Could you please work on the following consuming apps and services using the respective migration branch and verify if the SAST/DAST scan reports are generated:

Letter Angular
CGX Fileshare
Letter Service
CGX Assessment Service
CGX Authorization Service
For any guidance, feel free to reach out to Sridhar. Thank you!

Hi Team,

As mentioned, we are preparing to deploy seven applications—Letter Angular, Core API, Clinical Auth Service, CGX UI, Careplan UI, CGX Fileshare, and CGX API—and six services: Letters, CGX Careplan, AUTH Validation, CGX Assessment, CGX Authorization, and CGX Fax Service as part of our Milestone 1 plan.

Considering the critical timeline and to avoid impacting the current release, we’ve decided to move our deployment to the week following the regular release date. Tentatively, we’re aiming for Services to be deployed in production on 15/11 and consuming applications on 22/11. We’ll proceed with an ICAB change order, and we’d like to confirm if we can deploy the services and dependent applications directly from the migration branch, separately from the release branch. If so, what would be the recommended approach for merging changes back from the migration branch to the main branch?

Additionally, could you please confirm the process for toggling LaunchDarkly flags in production? Specifically, do we need any approvals to enable or disable these flags in production?

Thank you for your assistance!

Hi Shiva,

We are planning to deploy seven applications: Letter Angular, Core API, Clinical Auth Service, CGX UI, Careplan UI, CGX Fileshare, and CGX API; along with six services: Letters, CGX Careplan, AUTH Validation, CGX Assessment, CGX Authorization, and CGX Fax Service.

As part of our Milestone 1 plan, we’ve completed SIT functional testing (manual) for most of these in the QA3 environment. We’d like to ask for your support with automation test scenarios and recording results in QTest, mapped to individual stories.

Could you please confirm the following:

Is there a specific environment where we should deploy the code to run automated regression?
Is there a particular branch or build required for deployment, or is deploying from the migration branch sufficient?
How do we link QTest results to the individual stories?
Approximately how long would it take to complete regression for these seven applications?
Do we have any automated load testing setup for the six services?
Thank you for your guidance!

7 applications-
Letter Angular
Core API
Clinical Auth Service
CGX UI
Careplan UI
CGX Fileshare
CGX API

6 services-
Letters
CGXCareplan

Thank you for the confirmation! I was able to edit and submit my time for today. However, for the rest of the week (28/10-31/10), 
the timesheet shows as frozen or the hours are not editable for the assigned tasks. Could you please assist by filling in the hours for the remainder of the week from the backend? 
I’ll reach out if I encounter any issues with time entry from next week onward. Thank you!

SIT Functional Testing: Manual testing for SIT has been completed in both INT and QA3 environments.

API Testing: Except for the CGX Assessment, no API testing has been conducted for the service migration. (Blocked due to pending JSON files from developers.)

Letter Service Testing: 

Functional testing of Letter Angular and Core API applications has been completed in INT.
 Clinical Auth Service and CGX UI for the Letters service have been recently deployed to QA3, but testing has not yet occurred in INT.

CGX Careplan Service: Careplan UI, Core API, and CGX Fileshare (pending in QA) have been validated in both INT and QA3. CGX Fileshare testing can be completed today if a developer becomes available.

CGX Assessment Service: Testing of CGX UI for this service has been completed in both INT and QA.

CGX Authorization Service: Testing of CGX API, CGX UI, and Clinical Auth Service has been completed in QA.

Fax Service Testing: The CGX UI for Fax Service has recently been deployed in QA3, with no testing yet conducted in INT.

Reporting: Currently, all applications for a given service are grouped together, with a consolidated QTest report available that combines all applications pointing to each respective service.

SIT functional testing (Manual) has been done in INT & QA3.

NO API testing other than CGXAssessment was done for the service migration.(Blocked/Need JSON from Developers) 

Application - Letter Angular, Core API for letters service function testing completed in INT,

Application - Clinical Auth Service, CGX UI these application for letters service recetly deployed in QA3, no testing done on INT.

Application - Careplan UI, Core API, CGX Fileshare(Pending in QA) for CGXCareplan service all are validated in INT and QA3.If we get a dev then CGX Fileshare testing cn be completed today.

Application - CGX UI for CGXAssessment service done in INT and QA.

Application - CGX API,CGX UI,Clinical Auth Service for CGXAuthorization servicedone in QA

Application - CGX UI for fax service application recetly deployed in QA3, no testing done on INT.

Currently all application for a service is clubbed together and QTest report is availabe for all application pointing to a single services together.


We're fast-tracking the Milestone 1 release with isolated branch changes, aiming for deployment on 15/11 and app toggle on 22/11, pending ICAB approval and SRE/DevOps support

For the Milestone 1 release, we are already significantly behind the regular release cycle, so we plan to fast-track deployment. 
Our changes are isolated in a separate branch (not in the release branch). As part of the service deployment,
we intend to execute the change order for the services on 15/11, which will establish the on-premises environment. 
For the changes on the consuming apps side, we’re aiming for a scheduled release on 22/11, 
where we will implement a switch in the consuming apps to toggle from the Pioneer to the on-prem solution.

We have completed manual QA regression on our side, but we still need to wait for automated regression 
and load test results to validate and compare. We are treating this as an Infrastructure Change Order (ICAB) 
and would like to proceed on the mentioned dates. Your and the VP's approval is requested, 
along with support from the SRE and DevOps teams for the release activities.


I tried searching for the course by name or ID but couldn’t locate it. It seems it may need to be assigned to me for access. Could you please check on this?

M1-CGXCareplan: Migration of CGX Careplan Pioneer to On-Premises Service

The CGX Careplan Pioneer service is scheduled for sunset in January, with no planned renewal. To ensure service continuity, we must migrate all infrastructure associated with Pioneer to an on-premises environment through a lift-and-shift approach. This migration will involve setting up the on-premises infrastructure, ensuring full functional validation post-migration, and confirming compliance with all security and performance standards.

All components of the Pioneer service infrastructure are successfully migrated to the on-premises environment.
Network settings, data storage, and other resources are configured to match the current setup.
Functional validation is completed to confirm all features operate as expected in the on-premises setup.


Hi Becky, it seems that both SitecoreService and SiteScope are no longer necessary. Since the Sitecore applications aren’t active, 
the service account is also no longer needed. SiteScope monitoring was scheduled to sunset as early as 2021, 
and all applications were expected to transition to Dynatrace monitoring from that point. 
To answer your question, both are legacy and no longer required.

Slide 1: Hurdles for Pioneer Migration (Milestone 2 & 3)
Toggle Key Features Update

Excluding Humana.Clinical.Cgx.AuthUpdateUtility, other Toggle Key features removed from Milestones 2 and 3.
Streamlined as config-only updates, reducing team overhead and accelerating the timeline.
Single Branch Deployment

Transition to a single branch deployment model.
Application teams required to merge changes from the default branch independently as platform changes progress.
Limited Rollback Support

Minimal rollback options; parallel old-new system testing is restricted due to tight deadlines.
Issues to be handled with immediate resolutions to maintain stability.
Stakeholder Management

Complexity in maintaining stakeholder communication on the migration process, risks, and critical timelines.
Slide 2: Expectations and Preparations for Migration
Setting Realistic Performance Expectations

Transparent expectations around potential performance drops and downtimes during migration phases.
Data Clarity for Compliance

Identify data types within Pioneer for data security and compliance aligned with Data Governance requirements.
Post-Migration Monitoring

Limited insights on performance, error tracking, logs, and metrics post-migration due to Dynatrace and Splunk transitions.
Incident Handling Runbook

Prepare a runbook for incident management post-migration, specifying no rollback requirements for streamlined issue handling.
Traffic Results and Benchmarking

Collect necessary information to traffic and compare results, enabling accurate benchmarking post-migration.

Removing Toggle Key features from milestone 2 and 3 except for Humana.Clinical.Cgx.AuthUpdateUtility, which consumes ClinicalAuthorization
Single branch deployment going forward, if any application team wants to integrate our changes it's their responsibility to merge from default branch as this is a platform level changes.
Little to no support of roll back for the upcoming milestones not much option to run the old and new systems in parallel to ensure stability as the timeline is critical so any issues occurs we need to resolve it. 
Difficulty in maintaining stakeholders about migration process, risk and timelines
Establish realistic expactation regarding performace and potential downtimes during the migration
Clarity on kind of data that has been stored in pioneer platform for data security and compliance(Data govonance team)
no clarity on monitoring performace, errors, logs, matrics post migration tuning -- Onprem already hosted installed dynatrace switching, splunk
Create runbook for any incident handling for post migration issues -- no need for runbook
need information to traffic results to compare


Our action item for cgx_faxservice is to merge the code into our branch, deploy it in INT, and inform the team to initiate another round of SIT.

He is currently facing a certificate issue in his local environment for the Clinical Auth Service. The simplest solution would be to remove the feature flag and directly update the configuration for the Auth service. Considering the future projections, it seems reasonable to proceed without the feature flag to avoid being blocked by the certificate issue. Could you please confirm this exception, or should we seek additional support for him soon?
