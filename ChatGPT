Given that I am currently in the last trimester of my pregnancy, I am dealing with significant health issues. Whenever I discuss these matters in person or over the phone, it exacerbates my condition, causing increased stress, a heightened pulse, and feelings of suffocation. As such, I am documenting everything in writing to manage my health better and to ensure a smoother and more controlled discussion process.
