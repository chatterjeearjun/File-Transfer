 Validation and Review for SQLUtility & Bulk Messaging Service Migrations

Hi Team,

For Milestone 3, we identified two services—SQLUtility and Bulk Messaging—that are currently used internally. We plan to migrate and deploy these low-utilized resources to production on 12/27, ahead of the AEP freeze window.

We’ve completed API validation by comparing results between On-Prem and Pioneer, and no adverse outcomes were observed. However, since the Bulk Messaging service is used by the SRE team, we kindly request your validation for this service. The On-Prem URL is provided below for reference.

Additionally, the pull requests for the migrations of both services are attached. Please review them and let us know if you have any concerns.

Thank you!


Subject: Update on Release 24.12 Changes and On-Prem Deployment

Hi Team,

A quick update: the latest changes from Release 24.12 have been merged into our branch (ClinicalAuthorization_OnPrem_Pioneer_Migration2) for the ClinicalAuthorization Service. The updated build has been successfully deployed across all lower environments, including Test, INT, QA, QA2, and QAStress.

I kindly request the team to merge their code changes for Release 25.01 into our branch. Going forward, please deploy the changes in the on-prem environment and continue validation there.

For your reference, here is the link to the On-Prem Release pipeline:

Thanks,
