M1-CGXCareplan: Migration of CGX Careplan Pioneer to On-Premises Service

The CGX Careplan Pioneer service is scheduled for sunset in January, with no planned renewal. To ensure service continuity, we must migrate all infrastructure associated with Pioneer to an on-premises environment through a lift-and-shift approach. This migration will involve setting up the on-premises infrastructure, ensuring full functional validation post-migration, and confirming compliance with all security and performance standards.

All components of the Pioneer service infrastructure are successfully migrated to the on-premises environment.
Network settings, data storage, and other resources are configured to match the current setup.
Functional validation is completed to confirm all features operate as expected in the on-premises setup.


Hi Becky, it seems that both SitecoreService and SiteScope are no longer necessary. Since the Sitecore applications arenâ€™t active, 
the service account is also no longer needed. SiteScope monitoring was scheduled to sunset as early as 2021, 
and all applications were expected to transition to Dynatrace monitoring from that point. 
To answer your question, both are legacy and no longer required.

Slide 1: Hurdles for Pioneer Migration (Milestone 2 & 3)
Toggle Key Features Update

Excluding Humana.Clinical.Cgx.AuthUpdateUtility, other Toggle Key features removed from Milestones 2 and 3.
Streamlined as config-only updates, reducing team overhead and accelerating the timeline.
Single Branch Deployment

Transition to a single branch deployment model.
Application teams required to merge changes from the default branch independently as platform changes progress.
Limited Rollback Support

Minimal rollback options; parallel old-new system testing is restricted due to tight deadlines.
Issues to be handled with immediate resolutions to maintain stability.
Stakeholder Management

Complexity in maintaining stakeholder communication on the migration process, risks, and critical timelines.
Slide 2: Expectations and Preparations for Migration
Setting Realistic Performance Expectations

Transparent expectations around potential performance drops and downtimes during migration phases.
Data Clarity for Compliance

Identify data types within Pioneer for data security and compliance aligned with Data Governance requirements.
Post-Migration Monitoring

Limited insights on performance, error tracking, logs, and metrics post-migration due to Dynatrace and Splunk transitions.
Incident Handling Runbook

Prepare a runbook for incident management post-migration, specifying no rollback requirements for streamlined issue handling.
Traffic Results and Benchmarking

Collect necessary information to traffic and compare results, enabling accurate benchmarking post-migration.

Removing Toggle Key features from milestone 2 and 3 except for Humana.Clinical.Cgx.AuthUpdateUtility, which consumes ClinicalAuthorization
Single branch deployment going forward, if any application team wants to integrate our changes it's their responsibility to merge from default branch as this is a platform level changes.
Little to no support of roll back for the upcoming milestones not much option to run the old and new systems in parallel to ensure stability as the timeline is critical so any issues occurs we need to resolve it. 
Difficulty in maintaining stakeholders about migration process, risk and timelines
Establish realistic expactation regarding performace and potential downtimes during the migration
Clarity on kind of data that has been stored in pioneer platform for data security and compliance(Data govonance team)
no clarity on monitoring performace, errors, logs, matrics post migration tuning -- Onprem already hosted installed dynatrace switching, splunk
Create runbook for any incident handling for post migration issues -- no need for runbook
need information to traffic results to compare


Our action item for cgx_faxservice is to merge the code into our branch, deploy it in INT, and inform the team to initiate another round of SIT.

He is currently facing a certificate issue in his local environment for the Clinical Auth Service. The simplest solution would be to remove the feature flag and directly update the configuration for the Auth service. Considering the future projections, it seems reasonable to proceed without the feature flag to avoid being blocked by the certificate issue. Could you please confirm this exception, or should we seek additional support for him soon?
