Subject: Update on Release 24.12 Changes and On-Prem Deployment

Hi Team,

A quick update: the latest changes from Release 24.12 have been merged into our branch (ClinicalAuthorization_OnPrem_Pioneer_Migration2) for the ClinicalAuthorization Service. The updated build has been successfully deployed across all lower environments, including Test, INT, QA, QA2, and QAStress.

I kindly request the team to merge their code changes for Release 25.01 into our branch. Going forward, please deploy the changes in the on-prem environment and continue validation there.

For your reference, here is the link to the On-Prem Release pipeline:

Thanks,
